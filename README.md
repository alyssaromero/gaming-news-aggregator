# gaming-news-aggregator

## Description
This is a single-page web application to serve as a gaming news aggregator. I have selected four top web sources <br> 
for obtaining game related news: Game Informer, Gamasutra, Polygon, and Games Radar. I personally wanted to <br> 
create this application for my own use since I am often behind in what's going on in the gaming world. <br>
Hopefully, this could be useful to others as well so that obtaining the most recent news does not have <br>
to be time consuming or annoying. All of the "hard work" has been done for you, and for each news source, <br>
the twenty most recent articles posted on the site have been scraped and are displayed to the app's frontend.
